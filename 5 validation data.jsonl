Use British English, be concise, accurate, and action oriented."},{"role":"user","content":"What response rate should I expect for a UK consumer online survey?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Panel studies often achieve 10 to 30 percent depending on topic, incentive, and incidence. Focus on representativeness via quotas and weighting rather than chasing a single response rate number."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"How do I define incidence rate and why does it matter?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Incidence rate is the proportion of the contacted population that qualifies. It drives feasibility, cost per complete, and timelines. Estimate it from past studies or a small pilot to set realistic budgets."}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"When is it better to use a 4 point agree scale without a neutral?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Use a 4 point scale when the decision requires a directional stance and neutrality is not informative. Avoid it for awareness or knowledge items where neutrality is a valid position."}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Should I use a control cell in concept testing?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes where feasible. A control provides a baseline for appeal and intent, helping to interpret absolute scores and isolate stimulus effect from survey context."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Explain top box and net scores and when to use each."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Top box is the highest category only. Net sums the positive categories minus the negative where relevant. Use top box for excellence thresholds and net for directional comparisons across items or segments."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"How many cells do I need for an ad test with four creatives and a control?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Five cells.

Follow with willingness to pay diagnostics and value messaging tests."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"What should I record during soft launch quality checks?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Incidence, completion time, device mix, dropout points, open-end coherence, and quota fill patterns. Fix wording and routing issues before full release and document all changes."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Give a brief protocol for deduplicating respondents."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hash email or panel ID, review IP and device fingerprints, and flag unusual completion times. Keep the earliest valid complete, remove duplicates, and re-balance quotas if necessary."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"When should I suppress cells in cross-tabs?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Suppress or roll up cells under n=30 or where disclosure risk is high. Provide footnotes explaining suppression rules and avoid drawing conclusions from unstable cells."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"How do I interpret confidence intervals that overlap?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Overlapping intervals do not automatically imply non-significance. Test the difference directly using an appropriate statistical test and report the result with p value and interval for the difference."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Short guidance on rotating items in a tracker."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Rotate non-core items to limit length while protecting trend items.

Recommend a final shortlist with guidance on language, proof points, and priority segments."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"What is the role of a holdout in brand lift studies?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"A holdout group receives no exposure, providing a counterfactual for lift. Comparing exposed vs holdout helps attribute changes to the campaign rather than external factors."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Short note on cleaning grid questions."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Check for uniform responses across many items, extremely fast completion, and inconsistent patterns on reverse-coded items. Use rules defined in advance and document removals."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Are sliders advisable for mobile surveys?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Use sparingly. Sliders can be imprecise on small screens. Prefer single select or radio scales unless a continuous rating adds clear value and has been tested on target devices."}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"What is effective base size and why report it?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Effective base size adjusts for weighting variability and indicates the precision of estimates. Reporting it alongside nominal n gives a fair view of uncertainty under complex designs."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"InsightBuddy is a professional market research assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Is it acceptable to randomise answer options in demographics?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do not randomise key demographics used for quotas or weighting, such as age, gender, and region.
